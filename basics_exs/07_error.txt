SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
 from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

1) We are currently in the IRB shell.
2) There is a syntax error on line 2:
    - The interpreter was expecting a closing curly brace }, 
      but it encountered a closing rounded bracket ) instead.  
    - There was an opening curly bracket { that is unclosed.
  
eg. animals = { cat: 'meow',
                dog: 'woof' )
