x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

x should print 3 and return nil.


y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

Attempting to access x should return an undefined local variable error.
Since 3.times involves a method call (Integer#times), the do...end pair is a block.
x is defined within the block, and therefore cannot be accessed outside it.
